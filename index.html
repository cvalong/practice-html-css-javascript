      <h1>Christopher Long</h1>
      <p>Hello I'm a self-taught programmer <b>based in Southern California</b>. I've worked for major companies like Apple and Tesla as a data technician making <b>internationally</b> used maps and autopilot projects, <b>volunteered</b> at Conventions like Anime Expo. Traveled to Chicago to decompress after working with big tech, ran that all off by getting my mom to run her <b>first 5k</b>. I became a <b>dungeon master</b> organizing my friends for a year and sunk my life into maximizing Lost Ark. I learned about the power of self discipline and <b>stoicism</b>. I just love improving things, well mostly myself.</p>
      <p>I'm new to the world of development, but I'm learning the ropes of html/css/JS and Scrum. Soon hopefully obtain the power of <b>React</b>!</p>
      <p>If you want to know more or cheer me on just let me know.</p>
